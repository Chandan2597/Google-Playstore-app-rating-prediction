**Context -**

While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart
datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, I found out that iTunes App
Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like structure to allow for simple and easy web scraping. On the other
hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques (like dynamic page load) using JQuery making
scraping more challenging.

Each app (row) has values for catergory, rating, size, and more.

This information is scraped from the Google Play Store. This app information would not be available without it.

The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights
can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market!

The Internet is a true gold mine of data. E-commerce and review sites are brimming with a lot of untapped data with a prominent potential to convert into meaningful insights that can help with robust decision making. Here, I have explored using data science and machine learning techniques on data retrieved from one such avenue on the internet, the Google Play Store. I have predicted rating of an app. Used following pipeline to accomplish this task.

* Data Wrangling and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Selection
* Model Training
* Testing and Optimization
